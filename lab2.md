**3. Part 3**
- There are many things that I've learned from the lab in week 2 and 3 that I did not know before:
  [1] Remotely connect to a server from your local computer by key work "ssh"
  [2] Generate a public SSH Key by run "ssh-keygen" command from my local terminal.
  [3] Be able to distinguish private SSH Key and public SSH Key.
  [4] In order not to enter password everytime log into my remote server, I can generate a public SSH Key in my local computer and copy it to the remote server.
  [5] Use "scp" command to copy a path to public SSH Key into a specific remote account.
